                <li>Invitation</li>
                <p>My name is Daniel Ferre and I am studying Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth. I
                    would like to invite you to take part in my research study. Joining the study is entirely up to you,
                    before you decide I would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it would
                    involve for you. I will go through this information sheet with you, to help you decide whether or
                    not you would like to take part and answer any questions you may have. I would suggest this should
                    take about 5 minutes. Please feel free to talk to others about the study if you wish. Do ask if
                    anything is unclear.</p>
                <li>Study summary</li>
                <p>This study is concerned with the feasibility of dynamic touchscreen keyboards. This is important
                    because we live in an age where mobile technology plays a large role in our daily lives. This study
                    aims to see if they can be made easier to use through automatic adaptation to each individual user.
                    I am seeking participants who are aged 18+ and use a smartphone or tablet on a daily basis.
                    Participation in the research would require you to open a webpage on a mobile device and try a few
                    different keyboards, followed by some opinions on each of them, this will take approximately 30
                    minutes of your time.</p>
                <li>What is the purpose of the study?</li>
                <p>This study aims to see if typing speed and accuracy on mobile devices can be improved by
                    automatically adapting the sizes and positions of keys to the user's input patterns. Be it where the
                    user touches each key or how frequently the user makes a consistent typing error.</p>
                <li>Why have I been invited?</li>
                <p>You may have come across this study via a link shared across the internet. People of all ages over 18
                    from any background are welcome to participate.</p>
                <li>Do I have to take part?</li>
                <p>No, taking part in this research is entirely voluntary. It is up to you to decide if you want to
                    volunteer for the study. We will describe the study in this information sheet. If you agree to take
                    part, we will then ask you to sign the attached consent form, dated 11/4/23, version number, 1.0.
                </p>
                <li>What will happen to me if I take part?</li>
                <p>The study will present you with two keyboards, one will be a standard keyboard, that will be used as
                    the control for data collection. The other will be a dynamic keyboard, which will change the
                    positions and sizes of keys based on your hit points when any errors are made as you type. A
                    practice session will precede the data gathering sessions to allow you to get familiar with the
                    keyboard beforehand. The practice session will display borders around the keys to make you aware of
                    the default hit boxes for each key; these borders will be removed during the data gathering session
                    to remove variables that may introduce bias. You will be asked to type some pangram sentences using
                    these keyboards three times across two sessions, before being given the other keyboard to repeat the
                    task. The keyboards will be presented to you at random to avoid any biases that may occur as you use
                    them.</p>
                <li>Expenses and payments</li>
                <p>No payment will be offered if you choose to participate in this study.</p>
                <li>Anything else I will have to do?</li>
                <p>After you have participated in the study, you do not need to do anything else.</p>
                <li>What data will be collected and / or measurements taken?</li>
                <p>Upon completion of the experiment, your average typing speed for each test will be recorded alongside
                    any typing errors that you may have made. Any opinions of the tests will also be collected. This
                    data will be used to determine the effectiveness of the test keyboard developed in this study. No
                    personally identifiable information will be collected.</p>
                <li>What are the possible disadvantages, burdens or risks of taking part?</li>
                <p>There are no possible disadvantages, burdens or risks involved in taking part in this study.</p>
                <li>What are the possible advantages or benifits of taking part?</li>
                <p>Researching a better keyboard is beneficial because soft keyboards play a daily role in our digital
                    lives. A more efficient and ergonomic keyboard can aid in faster text entry and less errors when
                    performing common tasks such as messaging and searching the internet. Further benefits can be had as
                    well, including greater accessibility for those who have dexterity inhibiting diseases such as
                    arthritis.</p>
                <li>What will happen if I don't want to carry on with the study?</li>
                <p>Once you have completed the experiment, you will not be able to withdraw from the study, please
                    consider carefully before agreeing to participate.</p>
                <li>What if there is a problem?</li>
                <p>If you have a query, concern or complaint about any aspect of this study, in the first instance you
                    should contact the researcher if appropriate. If the researcher is a student, there will also be an
                    academic member of staff listed as the supervisor whom you can contact. If there is a complaint and
                    there is a supervisor listed, please contact the Supervisor with details of the complaint. The
                    contact details for both the researcher and any supervisor are detailed on page 1.</p>
                <li>Who is funding this research?</li>
                <p>The research outlined is receiving no funding.</p>
                <li>Who has reviewed the study?</li>
                <p>Research involving human participants is reviewed by an ethics committee to ensure that the dignity
                    and well-being of participants is respected. This study has been reviewed by the School of Computing
